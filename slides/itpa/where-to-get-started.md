### Where to get started

- Cybersecurity Certifications.
- Strong Operational background.
- Communication, written and presentation skills.
- Citizenship and security clearance are strong advantages.

Note:

Cybersecurity certifications are a good starting point for those looking to enter the field. They provide a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles and practices and can help you stand out in a competitive job market. However, generic certifications like CompTIA Security+ are not enough to secure a job in cybersecurity. You will need to specialise in a particular area, such as cloud security, network security, or application security, to be competitive.

If you are transitioning from another field, having a strong operational background can be an advantage. Experience in IT operations, system administration, or software development can help you understand how systems work and how they can be secured. This knowledge can be invaluable when working in cybersecurity, as it allows you to identify and mitigate security risks more effectively. It also allows you to "speak the language" of other IT professionals, making it easier to collaborate.

As the field often involves working with stakeholders from different parts of the business, strong communication, written, and presentation skills are essential. Practice your ability to explain complex technical concepts in simple terms, and work on your written communication skills to ensure that your reports and documentation are clear and concise. Don't be afraid to present your findings to your colleagues or other professionals, as this can help you build confidence and improve your presentation skills. There is also no shame in using tools like ChatGPT to help you write better reports. Just remember to proofread and edit the output to ensure accuracy.

Finally, having Australian citizenship and security clearance are strong advantages when working in cybersecurity. Some cybersecurity roles require you to work with sensitive information or critical infrastructure; especially in government and Defence sector, the necessary security clearances can open up more opportunities for you.

Please note that this roadmap is not exhaustive, and there are many other certifications available in the field and that these certifications are mostly vendor-neutral. You should also consider vendor-specific certifications like AWS Certified Security - Specialty, Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer, or Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate if you are working with specific technologies.

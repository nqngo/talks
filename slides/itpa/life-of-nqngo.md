## <span class="color-yellow-500">How I got here</span>

- Background in <span class="color-yellow-400">Systems engineering</span>.
- _CI/CD, automation, private cloud_.
- _Linux, Python, Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes_.
- Recruited by a cybersecurity consultancy to Digital Engineering.
- DevSecOps, cloud security, zero trust secrets management.
- Upskill in vendor-specific technologies like _CyberArk_, _HashiCorp_.

Note:

You don't need a cybersecurity background to enter the field. Leveraging your existing skills and experience can make the transition smoother. In fact, a diverse background can be an advantage, enabling you to bridge the gap between cybersecurity and business operations.

My focus is mainly on the DevSecOps space, which lies at the intersection of development, operations, and security. In a consultancy role, demonstrating expertise in vendor-specific technologies is crucial. Earning certifications in these areas is a significant advantage when working with clients.

However, while certifications can help you get your foot in the door, they're not a substitute for real-world experience. Continuous learning and adaptation are key to staying relevant in the field, and maintaining a home lab can be an excellent way to experiment and grow.

## <span class="color-yellow-400">What I do</span>

- Help organisations to secure their digital assets.
- Automate security controls and compliance.
- Secure software development lifecycle.
- Secure cloud infrastructure.
- Secure secrets management.
- Design and implement zero trust architecture.

Note:

My primary focus is on secrets and certificate management, often working with tools like HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk, and automation tools such as Ansible, Terraform, GitHub, GitLab, and Jenkins. I also secure containerised workloads with Kubernetes and Docker.

CI/CD is now a critical component of the software development lifecycle, allowing for faster and more reliable code delivery. However, it also introduces new security challenges, especially around secrets management. Everyone wants to ship code quickly, but no one wants to deal with the aftermath of a security breach.

Typically, a business will have an overarching security policy that they’ll ask you to implement. You need to understand the business context and translate that policy into technical requirements. Budget constraints also mean that the best solution isn't always the most secure one. You'll need to balance security with usability and cost.

This is where negotiation and communication skills are crucial. You must explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and business owners, and translate business requirements into technical requirements for developers.

## <span class="color-yellow-500">What I have learned</span>

- Your audience is not just the technical team.
- Engage with stakeholders, business owners, and developers.
- You need to understand the business context.
- Convert technical jargon into business language.
- Documentation is key.
- **Don't be a gatekeeper, be an enabler.**

Note:

Most engagements start with a business owner who needs a problem solved. You might not always have direct access to the technical team, so you need to explain complex technical concepts in a way that non-technical stakeholders can understand.

Understanding the business context is crucial. You must explain the technical implications of business decisions to the relevant stakeholders. Negotiation and communication skills are vital—you don’t want to be seen as an obstacle to progress, but you also need to ensure the business understands the risks involved and enforce security when necessary.

Documentation is critical for compliance and providing a record of decisions made, especially when dealing with audits or incidents. It also helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that you can refer back to previous decisions.

At the same time, you need to be an enabler. Good security isn't about saying no to everything; it's about finding ways to say yes securely. Business owners may have different goals from the technical team, so you need to balance these objectives and ensure secure business operations.

For instance, if the development team wants to ship code faster, but the business owner wants to ensure production environment secrets are logged and audited, a poor solution would be to create a manual form for secret requests. An enabling solution would be to automate the secret retrieval process while logging and auditing the requests.

You must also communicate different value propositions to different stakeholders. In the example above, you’d assure the business owner that secrets are logged and audited, while informing the development team that they can retrieve secrets more efficiently.

Ultimately, you need to strike a balance between security, usability, and cost. Saying no to everything won’t make you popular and will hinder your ability to get buy-in from the business and establish yourself as a trusted advisor.

## Cybersecurity Domains

Note:

A cyber domain is defined as the area in which computer systems and networks are used. It has a high degree of complexity and is continuously changing.

Depending on the context, a cyber domain can be defined in different ways. For us, we will follow the definition as provided by CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional).

1. Security and Risk Management
2. Asset Security
3. Security Architecture and Engineering
4. Communication and Network Security
5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
6. Security Assessment and Testing
7. Security Operations
8. Software Development Security

Note:

The CISSP defines eight domains of cybersecurity. These domains are designed to provide a comprehensive view of the cybersecurity landscape and cover a wide range of topics, from security and risk management to software development security. We don't have time to cover all of them in detail, but we will touch on some of the key concepts in each domain. We also do not recommend that everyone become a CISSP, but understanding these domains can help you build a solid foundation in cybersecurity.

*Security and Risk Management:* This domain covers the foundational principles of cybersecurity, including risk management, security governance, and compliance. Your work in this domain will revolve around identifying and managing risks, developing security policies and procedures, and ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

*Asset Security:* This domain focuses on protecting the assets of an organisation, including hardware, software and especially, data. You will need to ensure that data is classified and protected according to its value and sensitivity, and that appropriate controls are in place to safeguard it. Depends on the industry, there will be a need to secure the disposal of assets when they are no longer needed.

*Security Architecture and Engineering:* This domain covers the design and implementation of security controls to protect systems, networks, and data. You will need to understand how to design secure systems, select appropriate security technologies, and integrate security into the development lifecycle.

*Communication and Network Security:* This domain focuses on securing the networks and communication channels that connect systems and users. This is one of the classic domain in cybersecurity. You will need to understand how to protect data as it moves across networks, secure network devices, and implement secure communication protocols.

*Identity and Access Management (IAM):* This domain covers the management of user identities and access to systems and data. You will need to understand how to authenticate users, authorise access to resources, and manage user accounts securely.

*Security Assessment and Testing:* This domain covers the processes and techniques used to assess the security of systems and applications. You will need to understand how to identify vulnerabilities, test security controls, and evaluate the effectiveness of security measures. This is where penetration testing and vulnerability assessments come into play and is how cybesecurity is often portrayed in popular media.

*Security Operations:* This domain covers the day-to-day activities involved in managing and monitoring security controls. You will need to understand how to detect and respond to security incidents, manage security events, and maintain the security of systems and data.

*Software Development Security:* This domain covers the security considerations that need to be taken into account when developing software. You will need to understand how to design secure software, identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities, and ensure that security is integrated into the software development lifecycle.

### Mind Map of Cybersecurity Domains

Note:

One useful resource to scope a broad view of cybersecurity domains is from a LinkedIn article by Henry Jiang, CISO at Therapy Brands. This map is build upon the Tao Security Mind Map of Cybersecurity Domain by Richard Bejtlich. The latest version can be found at:

You usually specialise in one or a few domains depending on the size of your organisation and your role. However, it is likely that you will need to work across multiple domains at some point in your career. Understanding the relationships between the domains can help you develop a more holistic view of cybersecurity and make better decisions on your career path.

In this talk, we will focus on speaking about the domains that we have experience in and can provide practical advice on. We hope that this will help you build a solid foundation in cybersecurity and prepare you for a career in the field.

- Communication is the key to your success. I recommend to learn ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a set of practices and a framework for IT activities such as IT service management and IT asset management that focus on aligning IT services with the needs of the busines, which is beneficial for daily work. Seven guiding principles of ITIL  will help you to ensure the success of your cybersecurity implementaion.
1. Focus on value
2. Start where you are
3. Progress iteratively with feedback
4. Collaborate and promote visibility
5. Think and work holistically
6. Keep it simple and practical
7. Optimize and automate

## <span class="color-yellow-500">How I got here</span>

---

- My background: network engineer, then move to cybersecurity
- Specialised in security operation
- Passion for cybersecurity
- CEH/CISSP/CISM

Note:

I saw many people moved from vary positiions such as system engineer, developer to Cybersecurity. To start, you can learn Cybersecurity foundation and concepts. After graduating Bachelor of IT, I started my IT career as a network engineer and transitioned to Cybersecurity position. It is a game changer where I learnt more about security policies, security controls and NIST cybersecurity framework (6 functions: Govern/Identity/Protect/Detect/Response/Recover). My current job is security operation where I manage security technilogies such as Security information and event management (SIEM),  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Email Gateway, Vulnerability management and much more.

I have a passion for cybersecurity. We need that to grow our skills. Cybersecurity is fun but challenge. If you work in security operation, the pressue to detect and response a security incident is high. You never know what happens and your responsibility is to keep our data safe.

Besides daily activity, I love to develop my skills so I pursuit security certifications. They can help you to show the difference with the other candidates, at least from initial screening. Some don't like certifications but your choice.
Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) - know the attacker do
Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) - basic concepts of cybersecurity domains - at least 5 years working experience in two or more eight domains of CISSP
Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) - affirms your ability to assess risks, implement effective governance, and proactively respond to incidents, preferred credential for IT security managers - at least 5 years working experience of three CISM domains (total 4 domains)
planned Certified CyberDefender (CCD) - Blue team and SOC analyst certification - 48 hours exam lab, focusing on practical skills, simulating real work investigations

## <span class="color-yellow-400">What I do</span>

- Daily security monitoring for alerts and triage
- Perform security controls maintainance
- Uplift current security policies
- Perform risk assessment against vulnerabilities
- Be part of security incident response

Note:

- Every day, my job is to monitor security alerts and triage. We do have outsource SOC who monitor 24/7 but we still need to communicate with them for any issue/security event.
- Communication is the key to your success. I recommend to learn ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a set of practices and a framework for IT activities such as IT service management and IT asset management that focus on aligning IT services with the needs of the busines, which is beneficial for daily work. Seven guiding principles of ITIL  will help you to ensure the success of your cybersecurity implementaion.
1. Focus on value
2. Start where you are
3. Progress iteratively with feedback
4. Collaborate and promote visibility
5. Think and work holistically
6. Keep it simple and practical
7. Optimize and automate

Besides monitoring, I also need to maintain our security controls such as SIEM/EDR/Vulnerability Management/Email gateway. If we assess the effectiveness of our security controls following our NIST functions: Govern/Identity/Protect/Detect/Response/Recover, we have lots of work to do. I also develop and update current IT security policies to meet new requirements. The hard part of developing security policies is to make sure our policies can align with security strategy and risk appetide and receive supportive from other stakeholders.

One of the exciting parts on cyber is risk assessment. Risk assessment contains 3 parts: risk identification/risk analysis and risk treatment. How do you convince people that your risk assessment is comprehensive and reflect true risk rating? that is a challenge and depends heavily on your skills and experience. To assess a vulnerability, you have to put it in a context where we are at the moment (suffer from a breach or not), severity of the service, internet facing or not, CVSS score, mitigation controls (windows patching/EDR/email gateway/enterprise firewall etc...)

Last but not least, security incident response, one of the most challenging parts of cyber. You have to prove your skills to react current incident, to contain and eliminate the threat. "Eyes on glass" is what we hear from our CISO during incident response. The fight between attacker and blue team and who can win the game, the most fun of it.

## <span class="color-yellow-500">What I have learned</span>

- "Work under pressure" capability
- "Can do" attitude
- Five Properties of information security: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authenticity, and Non-repudiation to protect CIA triad of information
- Communication - key to your success

Note:

- Working in security operation is a challenge. We are required to "work under pressure" when neccessary. Especially during security incident response, threat hunting activity takes long and require patient. You may end up with unclear information and bunk of questions raised. You never know what happens in the future, but well prepare for the response.
- Many Australian companies love to hear that you can show up your "can do" attitude. A "can-do" attitude is a positive mindset that emphasizes determination, optimism, and a willingness to face challenges head-on. It is an approach where one focuses on possibilities rather than limitations and believes in their ability to accomplish tasks, overcome obstacles, and achieve goals. Proactive mindset
- CIA triad:
Confidentiality (tinh bao mat) is important to protect sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized parties. This includes protecting data at rest, in transit, and in use. Common techniques used to maintain confidentiality include encryption, access controls, and data masking.
Integrity is important to ensure that information has not been tampered with or modified in an unauthorized way. This includes protecting data from unauthorized modification, deletion or addition. Common techniques used to maintain integrity include digital signatures, message authentication codes, and data hashing.
Availability is important to ensure that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when they need them. This includes protecting against denial of service attacks and ensuring that systems are highly available and can withstand failures. Common techniques used to maintain availability include load balancing, redundancy, and disaster recovery planning.
Authenticity is important to ensure that information and communication come from a trusted source. This includes protecting against impersonation, spoofing and other types of identity fraud. Common techniques used to establish authenticity include authentication, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
Non-repudiation is important to ensure that a party cannot deny having sent or received a message or transaction. This includes protecting against message tampering and replay attacks. Common techniques used to establish non-repudiation include digital signatures, message authentication codes and timestamps.
These five properties form the foundation of information security and are critical to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information

Question to everyone: which property is the most important?
In my opinion, Availability property is critical and should consider with care when trying to uplift other properties. You can't protect a service you can't deliver

- Communication: as always, you are not alone. From time to time, you will need supportive from other team members and other stakeholders. That's a number 4 of ITIL: Collaborate and promote visibility . You need to let people know what you are doing and why. It will help to ensure your success.

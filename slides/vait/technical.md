## <span class="color-yellow-500">Technical & Problem Solving</span>

In this section, the interviewers will evaluate your technical skills and problem-solving abilities for the role. You might be asked to solve coding challenges, whiteboard problems, or discuss your approach to real-world scenarios.

### <span class="color-yellow-500">Be Honest About Knowledge Gaps</span>

- **DO:** Acknowledge areas where you lack knowledge and express willingness to learn.
  - <small>I haven't worked with Docker before, but I'm eager to learn more about containerisation and its benefits.</small>
- **DON'T:** Pretend to know something you don't.
  - <small>Oh, I'm very familiar with Rust. I can write a CLI app in Rust easily.</small>

### <span class="color-yellow-500">Learn to Tell a Story</span>

- **DO:** Structure your answers using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
  - <small>When our server went down (Situation), I identified that the root cause was an overloaded database (Task). I optimised the queries and increased server capacity (Action), reducing downtime by 80% (Result).</small>
- **DON'T:** Ramble or provide a long, unstructured story about your experience.
  - <small>I solved the outage by fixing the server after a lot of back-and-forth with the team.</small>

### <span class="color-yellow-500">The Interview is a Conversation</span>

- **DO:** Engage with the interviewer, ask clarifying questions, and seek feedback.
  - <small>Could you clarify the requirements for the project? I want to ensure I understand the scope correctly.</small>
- **DON'T:** Treat the interview as a one-sided interrogation. Be open to discussion.
  - <small>Yes, I can do that. No, I haven't encountered that before. Yes, I know that.</small>

### <span class="color-yellow-500">Break Big Problems Into Subsets</span>

- **DO:** Focus on a practical subset to address a specific challenge.
  - <small>A feasible starting point would be using a lightweight model like Qwen-4.5B to summarise customer support conversations for archival purposes, reducing the ticketing workload.</small>
- **DON'T:** Attempt to solve the entire problem at once without breaking it down.
  - <small>We can use AI to automate customer support. It's easy.</small>

### <span class="color-yellow-500">Specificity when Problem-Solving</span>

- **DO:** Provide clear details about the metrics, methodologies, and rationale behind problem-solving decisions.
  - <small>To address the memory leak, I would profile the application to identify the resource-intensive functions and optimise their memory usage by implementing a garbage collection strategy.</small>
- **DON'T:** Provide vague or ambiguous solutions without explaining the reasoning.
  - <small>We can move our workload to the cloud to solve the performance issue.</small>

---

### <span class="color-yellow-500">Don't Dismiss Problem Constraints</span>

- **DO:** Consider the constraints and limitations of the problem when proposing solutions.
  - <small>Given our data storage constraints, we could implement a data partitioning strategy to distribute the load across multiple servers and improve query performance.</small>
- **DON'T:** Disregard the constraints or propose solutions that are impractical or infeasible.
  - <small>We should just use OpenAI API. It's cheaper and faster than building our own model.</small></small>

## Hybrid Cloud

---

### Why Hybrid Cloud?

- Flexibility and Scalability
- Cost Optimisation
- Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

Note:
- *Flexibility and Scalability*: Hybrid cloud offers the flexibility to scale resources up or down based on fluctuating demands. It allows organisations to leverage the agility and scalability of public cloud for non-sensitive workloads, while keeping critical data and applications within a private cloud for enhanced security and control.
- *Cost Optimisation*:  Hybrid cloud enables organisations to optimise costs by leveraging public cloud for less sensitive or temporary workloads, reducing the need for dedicated infrastructure. It allows for cost-efficient resource allocation, avoiding unnecessary hardware investments and minimising operational expenses.
- *Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity*: Hybrid cloud facilitates robust disaster recovery and business continuity strategies. Organisations can leverage public cloud for backup and recovery purposes while keeping critical systems running on-premises or in a private cloud, ensuring data redundancy and minimizing downtime.

### Why not Hybrid Cloud?

- Complexity
- Data Integration and Interoperability
- Increased Management Overhead

Note:
- *Complexity*: Managing a hybrid cloud environment involves dealing with the complexity of integrating and orchestrating different cloud models and infrastructure. It requires expertise in multiple cloud architecture, networking, and security.
- *Data Integration and Interoperability*: Moving data between public and private cloud environments can present challenges in terms of data integration, consistency, and interoperability.
- *Increased Management Overhead*: Hybrid cloud requires managing multiple cloud environments. IT teams need to oversee multiple platforms, monitor performance, manage security, and ensure consistent governance across the entire hybrid cloud infrastructure.
